# Code_Switching_Dataset
Code-Switching (CS) is shifting from one linguistic code (a language or a dialect) to another.
Here, we seek to make CS data from a monolingual one by four methods: searching for transliterated words, word alignment after translation, concatenating sentences of different languages, and translating the answer part of chatbot data.
These methods result in about 16 million CS sentences out of our 37 million monolingual ones. By this, we can overcome the scarcity of CS data, which opens a door for more humanlike Deep Learning applications such as language, translation models, and real-life chatbots.
Paper will be published soon with full details ISA. <br />
