# Code_Switching_Dataset
Code-Switching (CS) is shifting from one linguistic code (a language or a dialect) to another.
Here, we seek to make CS data from a monolingual one by four methods: searching for transliterated words, word alignment after translation, concatenating sentences of different languages, and translating the answer part of chatbot data.<br />
These methods result in about 16 million CS sentences out of our 37 million monolingual ones. By this, we can overcome the scarcity of CS data, which opens a door for more humanlike Deep Learning applications such as language, translation models, and real-life chatbots.<br />
Paper will be published soon with full details ISA. <br />
